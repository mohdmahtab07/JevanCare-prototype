## 📱 About The Project

**JeevanCare** (जीवन केयर - "Life Care") addresses the critical healthcare accessibility gap in rural India. Nabha Civil Hospital serves 173 villages but has only 11 sanctioned doctors out of 23 positions, creating a severe shortage. With only 31% of rural Punjab households having internet access, we've built an optimized, offline-first healthcare solution.

### 🎯 The Problem

- **Doctor Shortage**: Only 11 out of 23 sanctioned doctor positions filled
- **Limited Access**: 173 villages relying on a single hospital
- **Poor Connectivity**: Only 31% rural internet penetration
- **Growing Demand**: Telemedicine adoption growing at 31% CAGR (2020-2025)
